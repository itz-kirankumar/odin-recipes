    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dal</li>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Poha</li>
        <li>Potato</li>
        <li>Corriander</li>
        <li>Ghee</li>

    <h3>STEPS TO MAKE IT !</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and soak the rice in one container and the dal and fenugreek seeds together in another container for 5-6 hours or over night, depending on the weather.</li>
        <li>Grind dal mixture together to a very smooth consistency. Next grind the rice smooth too and mix the two batters.</li>
        <li>Add salt and enough water to make into a dropping consistency. Leave to ferment over-night or more depending on the weather, till a little spongy.</li>
        <li>If thickened too much, add a little water to thin a bit. Heat tawa, and brush oil over it. When really hot, splash a little water over it, and immediately pour batter onto it, spreading it thin, with a circular motion.</li>
        <li>This will have to be very swift and will need a bit of practice.</li>
        <li>After spreading the batter, lower the heat and dribble a little oil around the edges so that it seeps under the dosa.</li>
        <li>When edges start browning a bit, pass a flat spoon under it to ease the dosa off the pan. Put desired filling in the center, and fold the two edges over.</li>
        <li>Serve accompanied with sambhar and chutney.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy based pan and add the mustard seeds, then onions, curry leaves and green chillies, and saute over high heat till the onions are a little transparent.</li>
        <li>Add the salt and the turmeric and mix well, before adding the potatoes.then,Turn the potatoes around till well mixed, and add the water, and let it simmer, for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
